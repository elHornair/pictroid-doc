# Pictroid-Doc

## About
This is the documentation for a (https://github.com/elHornair/pictroid)[school project]. It was written with plain web
technologies and can be compiled with (http://www.princexml.com/)[Prince]. It was only tested with Prince version 8.1 rev 5.

## Compilation
- Install prince
- Compile it using prince. If you use gnome, the following command is pretty handy
    prince --javascript index.html && gnome-open index.pdf
